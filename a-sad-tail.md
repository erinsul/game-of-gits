House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

Ned realized that Joffrey, the heir to the throne was a bastard and tried to get
him removed from the throne. However, he failed, and instead was (wrongly) executed for
treason.
