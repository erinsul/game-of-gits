House Stark of Winterfell is led by the just Eddard "Ned" Stark, Lord of
Winterfell, Warden of the North, Hand of the King, Protector of the Realm,
Regent.  He is surely honorable and will lead a long and prosperous life.

After Robert's death, Ned successfully challenges Joffrey's claim to the throne
and has the crazy little monster executed. He ascends the throne himself and rules
justly over Westeros.

But then Dany and her dragons cross the Narrow Sea and burn King's Landing, and
everyone there, including Ned, dies.
